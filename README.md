This game is a pirate-themed adaptation of the dice game [Perudo/Dudo/Liar's Dice](http://www.perudo.com/) for one player with an AI opponent.

The AI opponent is an [ACT-R](https://github.com/ntaatgen/ACT-R) model which can shift between a novice rule-based strategy (for inexperienced players), and a more advanced memory-based one (for players who want a bigger challenge).
